| 1   | [You are implementing a software as a service (SaaS) ASP.NET Core web service that will run as an Azure Web App. The web service will use an on-premises SQL Server database for storage. The web service also includes a WebJob that processes data updates. Four customers will use the web service. Each instance of the WebJob processes data for a single customer and must run as a singleton instance. Each deployment must be tested by using deployment slots prior to serving production data. Azure costs must be minimized. Azure resources must be located in an isolated network. You need to configure the App Service plan for the Web App. How should you configure the App Service plan?](#you-are-implementing-a-software-as-a-service-saas-aspnet-core-web-service-that-will-run-as-an-azure-web-app-the-web-service-will-use-an-on-premises-sql-server-database-for-storage-the-web-service-also-includes-a-webjob-that-processes-data-updates-four-customers-will-use-the-web-service-each-instance-of-the-webjob-processes-data-for-a-single-customer-and-must-run-as-a-singleton-instance-each-deployment-must-be-tested-by-using-deployment-slots-prior-to-serving-production-data-azure-costs-must-be-minimized-azure-resources-must-be-located-in-an-isolated-network-you-need-to-configure-the-app-service-plan-for-the-web-app-how-should-you-configure-the-app-service-plan) |
| 2   | [You are a developer for a software as a service (SaaS) company that uses an Azure Function to process orders. The Azure Function currently runs on an Azure Function app that is triggered by an Azure Storage queue. You are preparing to migrate the Azure Function to Kubernetes using Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaling (KEDA). You need to configure Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) for the Azure Function.
